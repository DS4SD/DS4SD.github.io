## Eni

<Row>
<Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>

[Eni](https://www.eni.com) is one of the "supermajor" oil companies and depends on hydrocarbon exploration to maintain its supply.
To explore a potential source of hydrocarbons, a basin, geoscientists analyse large document collections from many sources.
[Eni and IBM work together](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/06/eni-ibm-geological-data) on a Cognitive Discovery platform to parse and integrate these document sources into knowledge graphs.
[Eni's Cognitive Discovery](https://www.eni.com/en-IT/media/press-release/2019/06/eni-and-ibm-boost-geological-data-interpretation-thanks-to-artificial-intelligence-platform.html) runs on an IBM Power 9 super computer, installed on premises in the Eni Green Data Center in Ferrera Erbognone, Pavia, Italy.

## Wintershall Dea

<Row>
<Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>

[Wintershall Dea](https://wintershalldea.com) is a gas an oil producer that depends on geologists to search for new hydrocarbon sources.
Wintershall and IBM have developed the [Exploration Advisor Tool](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/client-voices/ai-helps-exploration-geologists-improve-predictions) to accelerate this search.
This tool serves as an intelligent search engine for geologists by analyzing large document collections.
